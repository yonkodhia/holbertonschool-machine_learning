## Tensorflow
Is a project practicing tensorflow commands and understand its logic by rewriting the hand written degits recognition by the help of tensorflow.

## General

* What is tensorflow?
* What is a session? graph?
* What are tensors?
* What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
* What are operations? How do you use them?
* What are namespaces? How do you use them?
* How to train a neural network in tensorflow
* What is a checkpoint?
* How to save/load a model with tensorflow
* What is the graph collection?
* How to add and get variables from the collection

## Tasks
0. Placeholders
1. Layers
2. Forward Propagation
3. Accuracy
4. Loss
5. Train_Op
6. Train
7. Evaluate
